                    Extract the prayer times from the following text.

                    - Prayer times must be copied exactly as written in the text (e.g., "10:00 PM" stays "10:00 PM").
                    - Do not round, adjust, or guess times.
                    - If multiple times are present for the same prayer, still apply the earliest= start, latest= iqamah rule,
                    but the values themselves must be identical to the original text. 
                    - Prayer names may have different spellings (e.g., "Fajr" → "Fajar", "Maghrib" → "Magrib").
                    - {{prayer}}_start is also referred as *adhan* / *begins* / *khutbah* / *azan* etc. 
                    - {{prayer}}_iqamah refers to the later congregational prayer time (*salah* / *salat*).
                    - If multiple times are listed for the same prayer, use the **earliest** as {{prayer}}_start
                    and the **latest** as {{prayer}}_iqamah.
                    - ⚠️ If **only one time** is mentioned for a prayer, assign the value to {{prayer}}_iqamah and set
                    {{prayer}}_start = null. 
                    - ⚠️ Sometimes times are joined directly with words without spaces (e.g., "Khutbah1:30pm" or "Iqamah2:00pm").
                    In such cases, you must still detect and extract the time exactly as written ("1:30pm", "2:00pm").
                     Do not ignore times just because they are attached to words.
                    - ⚠️ Sometimes times are broken by newlines or irregular spacing (e.g.,
                    "6\n:30\npm" should be understood as "6:30 pm").
                    You must normalize and extract the correct time string exactly as written, without losing AM/PM.
                    - If you can't find a valid time for a prayer, (ex: sometimes Maghrib times are represented as 'sunset' 
                    in websites) set the value = null.
                    
                    - Only move on to jummah timings once you have completed evaluating values for fajr, zuhr, asr, maghrib and isha.
                    - Jummmah (Friday) prayer can have up to 3 slots: jummah1, jummah2, jummah3.
                    - Jummah (Friday) prayer times:
                        - After assigning Fajr, Zuhr, Asr, Maghrib, and Isha, re-check the text for any times between 12:00 PM and 5:00 PM.
                        - ALL times in that range, near other jummah timings, must be treated as Jummah times, even if not labeled with the word "Jummah" or
                        it's alternate spellings.
                        - Collect all valid Jummah times, sort them ascending, then distribute using the following pattern:
                            * 1 time → jummah1_iqamah only (start = null).
                            * 2 to 5 times → assign left to right as start/iqamah pairs; if odd (3) or (5), last one is iqamah only.
                            * 6 times → assign as 3 full start/iqamah pairs.
                        - Within a pair, the earlier = start, later = iqamah.
                        - If no times exist in the range, set all Jummah fields to null.
                        - If a Jummah slot is written as Khutbah X:XX followed by Iqamah Y:YY and there can be commas not seperated by spaces, then 
                        Khutbah time must always be the start and Iqamah time the iqamah, even if the text is irregularly formatted.
                        - Special case for jummah (do NOT output this example, it is only to guide you):
                        - If the input text contains:
                            Fajr 5:08 AM 6:00 AM  
                            Dhuhr 1:19 PM 2:00 PM  
                            Asr 6:05 PM 6:45 PM  
                            Maghrib 8:04 PM 8:08 PM  
                            Isha 9:30 PM 10:00 PM  
                            1:45 PM 
                            Jumu'ah 
                            2:45 PM 
                            Jumu'ah 
                            3:45 PM 
                            Jumu'ah 
                            6:33 AM 
                            8:04 PM
                        - Then the correct output must include:
                            "jummah1_iqamah": "1:45 PM",  
                            "jummah2_iqamah": "2:45 PM",  
                            "jummah3_iqamah": "3:45 PM"
                        - Just notice how I considered 1:45 PM as a valid jummah time, ONLY because it's in jummah time range, near other jummah timings,
                        even though it's not tied to a specific jummah word following the pattern.
                        * If a line contains both "Khutbah" and "Iqamah" times, always map:
                        - The Khutbah time → jummahN_start
                        - The Iqamah time → jummahN_iqamah
                        * This rule applies even if the Khutbah time is joined to the word (e.g., "Khutbah1:30pm")
                            or split across lines (e.g., "1\n:30 pm").
                        * Do not skip Khutbah times. They must always be extracted as the start time.
